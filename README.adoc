*RandomWalk* is a simulation of a simple dice-playing game.
The (solitary) player begins with $4 and repeatedly rolls
a die.  If it comes up even, he wins one dollar. If it comes
up odd, he loses a dollar.

*Install:* Run `sh build.sh`

*Source files:* `src/randomWalk.elm` is the game simulation file.
It relies on `src/Graph.elm`.  This module is of general use
for drawing graphs.

*Run:* Open `index.html` in your browser

*Image:* the image `randomWalk.jpg` gives an image of one game.
